Besides \u0026ldquo;summing it up\u0026rdquo; in a paper, we need from time to time to make presentations to be shown on screen for our team members, students, bosses, and our colleagues from other organisations. Those of us who need to insert a lot of math in their presentations, eventually meet the dilemma of choosing between the convenience of visual arrangement of things in MS PowerPoint and the easiness of typesetting beautiful math expressions provided by $\\LaTeX$ (combined with Beamer, its excellent package for preparing presentations).\nFor my TU-related presentations, I\u0026rsquo;ve completely switched to Beamer approximately 7 years ago, and after some steep learning curve (not of $\\LaTeX$, which I managed to master somewhere in 20th century, but of Beamer, which has 247 page-long manual), I\u0026rsquo;ve got used to it, made some convenient keyboard shortcuts in TeXstudio and was quite satisfied with my tool.\nExcept for some minor but quite irritating and time demanding issues of alignment between different views of the same slide and difficulties of visually fine-tuning content of a slide (read: move a couple of pixel this to the left and rotate slightly clockwise that object and draw an arrow from this word to that part of the picture in another column and make it not jumping when a new portion of the figure is revealed in the following view).\nMost of the pictures for my presentations and lectures I was drawing in my favourite graphics editor with ability to embed $\\LaTeX$ labels named Ipe, which I was using since my PhD times. And maybe because I was using it for so long time, I was completely not aware that besides preparing nice pictures for a presentation, I could do the whole presentation in it too!\nLast month, after recommending Ipe to one more colleague, I‚Äôve looked again in its manual and I‚Äôve discovered that it has this nice functionality. Of course, the very next presentation I‚Äôve done for my TU Delft colleagues was made completely in Ipe. And it was quite a relief, I should say! Everything was very easy to fine-tune visually, you can enjoy a lot of snapping modes, you can add new views and reveal parts of the drawing without fear that everything would jump suddenly, and of course you can type everything you need in $\\LaTeX$!\nThe only thing I needed to learn is how to make a template for a presentation according to the recommended TU Delft house style. As I‚Äôve spent quite a long time on this ( this resource of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology was extremely helpful), I thought it would be good to share it here with everyone interested in using Ipe for presentations and preparing their own templates. So I made this\nMini-tutorial on making custom templates in Ipe The instructions below are for TU Delft style, but of course, they can be easily adjusted to your needs.\n  Open IPE and save the empty file in a separate folder. I have folder TUD-slides and file name TUD-slides-template.ipe.\n  As recommended in Ipe manual on stylesheets, let‚Äôs create TUD-slides.isy file in the same folder: open a text editor with good XML support (notepad++ or VS code), type the following lines\n  \u0026lt;ipestyle name=\u0026quot;TUD-slides\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ipestyle\u0026gt;  and save it in the same folder as TUD-slides.isy\n in Ipe, go to Edit -\u0026gt; stylesheets, delete basic, add presentation and our new TUD-slides:   Let‚Äôs start with adding styles and symbols to our style sheet to make a template according to TU Delft house style. First, let‚Äôs define the primary and secondary colours. For this, we need to convert the given RGB values from the range 0..255 to the range 0..1. A simple way to do it is to create a filled rectangle in Ipe, set it absolute colour as RGB given by TUD style (e.g. 0,163,144), then right-click it and show it as XML From this you can copy-paste the values \u0026ldquo;0 0.639 0.565\u0026rdquo; to the style file, like \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-green\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0.639 0.565\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;. You can select a fancier name using this site, for instance here it gives ‚Äúpersian-green‚Äù. Now our style file looks like\n\u0026lt;ipestyle name=\u0026quot;TUD-slides\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-cyan\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0.651 0.839\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-black\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0 0\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-white\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;1 1 1\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-allports\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0.4 0.635\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-persian-green\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0.639 0.565\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-blue-lagoon\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0.443 0.533\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-bermuda\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0.51 0.843 0.776\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-hippie-blue\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0.38 0.643 0.706\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-cerulean\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0 0.718 0.827\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-feijoa\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0.6 0.824 0.549\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-saffron\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0.945 0.745 0.243\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-persian-red\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0.765 0.192 0.184\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;color name=\u0026quot;TUD-burnt-sienna\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;0.922 0.447 0.275\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ipestyle\u0026gt;  Save it and use Edit -\u0026gt; Update style sheets. Now all TUD colours should be available in Ipe:   Now let‚Äôs proceed with a slide layout according to power-point examples or latex-beamer examples. Although the beamer examples are a little bit outdated, they seem to me more suitable for presenting scientific information. Let‚Äôs make a horizontal colour band with white TUD logo on it.\n Draw the band with TUD-cyan fill colour. For placing a logo, we can either place a png image (File -\u0026gt; Insert image)or use an ability of IPE of \\includegraphics command from Latex package pgf or convert the eps file to IPE. I‚Äôve used the second option. For this:  Make figs subfolder and download there the logo in eps format. I‚Äôve added \\usepackage{pgf} to the preamble using Edit -\u0026gt; Document properties I‚Äôve converted the .eps logo to .pdf format using utility ps2pdf (you should have it installed if you have MikTeX):  ps2pdf14 -dEPSCrop TU_P5_white.eps TU_P5_white.pdf Then I created a text label and entered there \\includegraphics[height=48pt]{figs/TU_P5_white.pdf}, where 48 pt was the height of my colour bar. To make the log exactly 48 pt height, enter any absolute value for the text label size. The reason is that it is stretched in the presentation stylesheet.      Now let‚Äôs add useful information to this colour bar, like name of the presenter and the presentation short title (useful if someone joins your talk in its middle) and page numbers. Name and presentation title we might want to use in several places, so let‚Äôs code them in the preamble as Latex commands first: Edit-\u0026gt;Document properties and add there\n   \\newcommand{\\name}{My Name} \\newcommand{\\prestitle}{Template for Ipe Presentations}  Now you can create a text label with something like \\name{} $\\cdot$ \\prestitle inside. Make it centre-aligned and of white colour. Your canvas should look like this now:  The font used does not correspond to the house style of TU Delft. It should use Arial for body text and Georgia for quotes. This can be done if we will use $Lua\\LaTeX$ or $Xe\\LaTeX$ as compiler and use package fontspec. Provided you have installed the fonts in your system, add to the Latex preamble the following:\n\\usepackage{fontspec} \\newfontfamily\\tudtitlefamily[ Extension = .ttf%, ]{TUDelft-UltraLight} \\newfontfamily\\tudrmfamily[ Extension = .ttf, BoldFont = *_Bold, ItalicFont = *_Italic, BoldItalicFont = *_Bold_Italic]{Georgia} \\newfontfamily\\tudsffamily[ Extension = .ttf, BoldFont = *_Bold, ItalicFont = *_Italic, BoldItalicFont = *_Bold_Italic]{Arial}  and change the Latex engine to lualatex:   (I‚Äôve changed it, please see later). Set the absolute value for the line to 20 pt.\nFinally, add a text label with dummy page numbering. Now you should have something like that:\n Now let‚Äôs make a symbol from the colour bar, logo, and status line. Select them (without the page number) and group together (Ctrl+G). Make a symbol from this group: Ipelets-\u0026gt;symbol\u0026gt;create symbol (in top stylesheet) with the name Background (note the capital ‚ÄúB‚Äù). Check that the symbol works by creating a new page. It should have this colour bar.\n  Save the changes in the style file: Edit -\u0026gt; Style sheets, select TUD-slides and press save. Overwrite your old file. Notepad++ should show your the updated version\n  Now you can delete this group but still see the same symbol.\n  Let‚Äôs style the page number. Switch on the page numbering in Document properties. You will see black number in the lower left corner. We are going to change it to our style. First, update the stylesheet. Now, according to https://ipe.otfried.org/manual/onepage.html#sec:presentations add\n\u0026lt;pagenumberstyle pos=\u0026quot;20 820\u0026quot; size=\u0026quot;Huge\u0026quot; color=\u0026quot;0.5 0 0\u0026quot; valign=\u0026quot;top\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\\arabic{ipePage}/\\arabic{ipePages}\u0026lt;/pagenumberstyle\u0026gt;    to the stylesheet. Right-click your dummy page number, select Edit as Xml and copy the parameters to the pagenumberstyle\n\u0026lt;pagenumberstyle pos=\u0026quot;736 16\u0026quot; color=\u0026quot;TUD-white\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;label\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;38.78\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;14.509\u0026quot; depth=\u0026quot;0.24\u0026quot; halign=\u0026quot;right\u0026quot; valign=\u0026quot;baseline\u0026quot; size=\u0026quot;20\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\\arabic{ipePage}/\\arabic{ipePages}\u0026lt;/pagenumberstyle\u0026gt;  Now you can update the style sheet and delete your dummy page numbering and check how the page numbers are inserted automatically.\nBefore we proceed, let‚Äôs also move the Latex styling that user should not change to the style file. Make a new section in the style file\n\u0026lt;preamble\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/preamble\u0026gt;  and move there font settings and packages.\nOn the first page, create a new layer called BACKGROUND (note all capitals). Draw there the desired layout (you can use the defined commands like \\prestitle and \\name)\nCongratulations, the template is ready! To make a new presentation, just make a copy of the TUD-slides folder (including figs) subfolder, and edit TUD-slides-template.ipe file.\nPossible improvements You can convert the logo from PDF to Ipe format (using pdftoipe script supplied with Ipe) and make a symbol of it, which you can save in a the stylesheet and make it self-contained and independent from a logo saved in external folder. You can then move the file to Ipe style folder (use Help -\u0026gt; Show configuration to find out where it is located) and create new presentations in TU Delft style just by activating this stylesheet.\nYou can find the results of such modification here.\n","date":1640617694,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640617694,"objectID":"c65731db343dc0129f84dbf59888cd9f","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/post/ipe_presentation_template/","publishdate":"2021-12-27T16:08:14+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/ipe_presentation_template/","section":"post","summary":"Ipe, a powerful vector graphics editor for creating scientific drawings with inclusion of $\\LaTeX$ annotations, is also suitable for creating complete presentations.

A simulation of a dynamical system shows the closed-loop performance not being susceptible to the combination of candidate models. Additionally, the broad applicability of CLAMD is shown by means of a demonstrative application in automated visual inspection.

The performance of the method is tested in a simulation of an adaptive optics system, where the small-phase assumption is enforced by considering a closed-loop system that uses a low-resolution wavefront sensor to control a deformable mirror. The results confirm the computational efficiency of the algorithm and show a large robustness against noise and model uncertainties.","tags":["Analytical techniques; Image quality; Optical systems; Phase diversity; Phase retrieval; Wave front sensing"],"title":"Phase retrieval of large-scale time-varying aberrations using a non-linear Kalman filtering framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

A three-channel multi-aperture digital telescopic system with super-resolution realizes two methods of digital image processing that can compensate the distortions introduced by a non-uniform distribution of the refractive index along the optical observation path. A comparative analysis of these methods was conducted, and their advantages and limitations are described in this paper. The results of theoretical investigations are confirmed experimentally by observing stationary and dynamic objects under the conditions of heavy atmospheric turbulence.

While this problem seems trivial (the exact formulae for Zernike polynomials are known) and is often used as MSc student assignment, it might become challenging for higher degrees of the polynomials due to their fast oscillating nature.\nRecently, a fast and robust method of calculation of the Zernike polynomials and their derivatives in Cartesian coordinates was published [1]. I decided to give it a try and to program it in Julia, as the existing Julia\u0026rsquo;s implementations were not so far from the MSc student\u0026rsquo;s homework versions and are quite slow.\nIt was indeed really easy to translate the published pseudo-code in Julia.

To get access to it and use it, one needed just to activate the developer mode and voil√† \u0026mdash; you typed bash and got Ubuntu 2016 (in terminal only). I tried it, installed python via conda, watched how the free space on my fast but small system drive (SSD) quickly disappeared and forgot it.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Internet some news about WSL2, the second version of this Linux subsystem. Publications praised the diversity of the distributives (you are not limited to Ubuntu anymore), a closer integration with Windows (you can call Windows programs from Linux, and the filesystems of Windows and Linux can be accessed bidirectionally), and I also saw some manuals how to install WSL on another drive. Finally I\u0026rsquo;ve got some time to try it, and it worked even better than I expected! Namely, the benefit I\u0026rsquo;ve got is a faster version of Julia on my computer (not to mention enjoying 24K colours in REPL and normal work of all commands in the shell mode üòâ).\nHere are the results from a simple benchmarking of convolving a 512 x 512 image with a 48 x 48 blur kernel. (In our MADEin4 project, we need to simulate a position-dependent blur, so the convolution speed is a very important parameter for us).\nThe screenshots below show (left to right) the speed of this convolution (two different algorithms) calculated by Julia running in WSL and Julia running in Windows, both versions 1.5.2 (and the same convolution made in Mathematica 12.1 for comparison purposes). You can see that the faster version of the algorithm (the second benchmark test) in WSL is almost twice faster as in its Windows version and is approximately as fast as Mathematica implementation.\n  Convolution speed in JuliaWSL, JuliaWindows, and in Mathematica   How to install WSL2 where you want it Here are the successive steps that I did, following the nice instructions of this tutorial. Everything can be done directly in PowerShell, or, if you are not familiar with it, in a more Windows manner using your mouse.\n Press Windows key and type \u0026ldquo;Optional Features\u0026rdquo;, press enter to open the following settings page and select there \u0026ldquo;More Windows features\u0026rdquo;: or just open PowerShell and enable the WSL2 by executing:  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux  I needed to do it despite that I had already the WSL enabled (WSL1, the \u0026ldquo;Legacy version\u0026rdquo;), and I needed to reboot after this command.\nIf you have not yet created a directory where you want to have your Linux, create it. You can use the following PowerShell command or a less exotic way like right-click in the explorer window and so on:  New-Item D:\\Linux -ItemType Directory  cd there. Again, you can use the special PS command (it also can change the drive):  Set-Location D:\\Linux  Now you need to download the desired Linux distro and place it in this directory. Go to this page, choose what you want, right-click and save it or again you can use the PowerShell: copy the link address and substitute it in the command below.  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2004 -OutFile Ubuntu.appx -UseBasicParsing  Rename the downloaded \u0026ldquo;.appx\u0026rdquo; file in \u0026ldquo;.zip\u0026rdquo; file and extract it (here shown on example of Debian distro)   or\nRename-Item .\\Ubuntu.appx Ubuntu.zip Expand-Archive .\\Ubuntu.zip -Verbose  Congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve almost done. Now you can change to the extracted directory and double click the \u0026ldquo;linux_distro.exe\u0026rdquo; file   or execute in the PowerShell\n.\\Ubuntu\\ubuntu2004.exe  Input you username and password (remember them well or save them immediately in your password manager, like KeePass), and after some time the installation will be finished.\nYou can use your WSL2 now!\n7.(OPTIONAL) Because I had still traces of the old WSL system (although I have uninstalled it), I needed to issue the following command to make my new WSL2 act as default Linux subsystem (e.g. I can invoke it by typing bash in terminal):\nwsl --set-default-version 2 wslconfig /s Ubuntu-20.04   You can also launch it by executing wsl or ubuntu commands   Also I recommend to instal the new Windows Terminal, where you will have immediately easy access to all you Linuxes :-)\nHow to install \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; release of Julia in your WSL To install Julia in your WSL, you can use the packages provided by the distro, but chances are high you\u0026rsquo;ve got some old version. Instead, install the latest stable release from jullialang.org.\nBasically, you need to follow the instructions from their webpage.\nFor more detailed instruction, follow this tutorial.\nTo summarize, it\u0026rsquo;s as easy as downloading, unpacking, copying to /opt directory, and making a link:\n$ wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.5/julia-1.5.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz $ tar -xvzf julia-1.5.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz $ sudo cp -r julia-1.5.2 /opt/ $ sudo ln -s /opt/julia-1.5.2/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia  Now you can try to type julia and see it working!\n Note: in Debian installation, I was not able to use wget command shown above; the system complained about not valid security certificates of julialang.org. The problem was solved by installing CA-certificates:\n$ sudo apt-get install ca-certificates     My Ubuntu 20.04 installation appeared to be extremely slow in installing julia packages (\u0026ldquo;updating registry\u0026rdquo;); julia itself was running fast. Debian installation does not have such problem and is now my default WSL.   How to use your installation in VS code or Jupyter lab VS Code To connect VS Code to WSL, I followed its manual page. As I\u0026rsquo;ve had VS Code already installed, I needed to add %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\bin to my path manually.\nThen I navigated to my Windows folder with Julia projects (thus not in WSL filesystem) and opened it from bash by executing code ..\nIn addition, I installed in this version of VS Code the julia extension (see here for more detailed instructions).\nJupyter lab You can install in your distro conda, Python and Jupyter as usual, and set julia to use them, but in this case, I decided to keep everything within the julia installation.\nFirst as usual, ] add IJulia and launch Jupyter lab from within julia:\njulia\u0026gt; using IJulia julia\u0026gt; IJulia.jupyterlab() install Jupyter via Conda, y/n? [y]: y  Give julia some time to install everything necessary and wait until the activity in the terminal ends with a message beginning like\n[ Info: running setenv(`/home/oleg/.julia/conda/3/bin/jupyter lab`,[\u0026quot;PATH=/home/oleg/.julia/conda/3/bin:  Actually, now the jupyter server is installed and running, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a browser installed in WSL, you cannot go further. Press Ctrl+C here. Now we are going to create and edit jupyter config file so any existing Windows browser could be used.\nTo create the config file, execute in bash\n$ ~/.julia/conda/3/bin/jupyter notebook --generate-config  The system will display something like\nWriting default config to: /home/oleg/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py  Now open this file in VS Code\n$ code ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py  and find and edit there the default browser setting (line beginning with c.NotebookApp.browser ). I set it to MS Edge, which I don\u0026rsquo;t use usually, so my Jupyter lab activities are kept separately from my usual web browsing:\nc.NotebookApp.browser = u'/mnt/c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Microsoft/Edge/Application/msedge.exe %s'  In addition, disable the redirect file behaviour by changing the line starting with c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file to\nc.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False  Now yuo should be able to launch Jupyter lab either from julia\njulia\u0026gt; using IJulia julia\u0026gt; IJulia.jupyerlab()  or from bash\n$ ~/.julia/conda/3/bin/jupyter lab  ","date":1601925139,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601925139,"objectID":"3b48397f0db64df5b66244dc89e43bdf","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/post/juliawsl/","publishdate":"2020-10-05T21:12:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/juliawsl/","section":"post","summary":"Windows 10 offers a friendly way to instal and use Linux system (the so-called WSL).

The repeating last two steps can be automated in a script or a batch file that can be run on a local computer, so every time the content is updated, its rendered version is uploaded to the web. If however, the content is edited with some online services, like Forestry, how can you update the rendered html pages?\nThis can be done with automated deployment workflows. For this, you need to have an account on one of the multiple services that provide you (often free of charge for a small or a personal project) a virtual machine, where the source of your site can be downloaded, Hugo installed and run on the source, and in case of success, the rendered html pages uploaded to the destination. Sounds really high tech and fantastic, but it seems to be quite a common practice amongst the professional developers, called Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The links to instructions for several services are collected on a Forestry doc page and on Hugo doc pages as well.\nFor an occasional user of this method, however, it is easy to make a mistake in setting it up and running. Moreover, different services have different requirements and limitations. GitLab, for instance, provides built-in CI/CD, but publishes the results on their webpages which have way too long url, in my opinion. Here I describe the steps which finally lead me to a successful implementation.\nI have followed the steps for automatic deployment with Wercker, with some changes. My site source repo was already set up on GitHub, and I was hosting the rendered version on GitHub pages, so I proceeded directly to the step of Wercker setup. Wercker is a service that can monitor the status of my site source repo, and after I push some content to it, it performs the automated deployment steps. It seems that Wercker\u0026rsquo;s interface has been updated since the time the manual was written, and some steps that require changes are indicated below.\nI have logged in with my GitHub account, so the link between Wercker and GitHub was automatically created. Then I proceeded till Add your project step, which now should be changed to Add application. Use the boxed plus button in the top right corner:\nThe application is created in 4 steps, where I have pointed to the repo with my website source and accepted all default options. Now I was at \u0026ldquo;App successfully created step and there were some small differences. The screen I saw was like that: I saw there Hugo icon, clicked it, obtained some config file,and \u0026hellip; And actually I didn\u0026rsquo;t need it.\nInstead, I needed to go to the \u0026ldquo;Steps store\u0026rdquo; (again top right corner), to find there \u0026ldquo;hugo build\u0026rdquo; steps script, and to read its documentation to understand how to use it. Finally, I understood that all I needed to do is simply to create a file named wercker.yml in the root of my source repo with the following content:\nbox: debian build: steps: - arjen/hugo-build: version: \u0026quot;0.68.3\u0026quot; theme: academic  and push it to the GitHub repo.\nWercker has started its job and\u0026hellip; failed.\nAfter some investigation, I realized that the reason was that the \u0026ldquo;academic\u0026rdquo; theme which I use was installed as a submodule (so it is not a part of my repo), and thus it was not downloaded from git. To fix that, I added steps to the wercker.yml which installed git and downloaded the submodule. Now the file looked as shown below, and Wercker has completed the build successfully!\nbox: debian build: steps: - script: name: install git code: | apt-get update apt-get install git -y - script: name: initialize git submodules code: | git submodule update --init --recursive - arjen/hugo-build: version: \u0026quot;0.68.3\u0026quot; theme: academic  Then I proceeded with the manual up to the step Set the App‚Äôs Deploy Target, where I was stuck again, because there were no button \u0026ldquo;Deploy target\u0026rdquo; in the Wercker interface. Instead, I needed to create a new pipeine and to call it deploy, and to add it to the workflow after the build pipeline: Then I added the corresponding instructions to the Wercker config file as shown below, pushed it to GitHub and everything worked!\nbox: debian build: steps: - script: name: install git code: | apt-get update apt-get install git -y - script: name: initialize git submodules code: | git submodule update --init --recursive - arjen/hugo-build: version: \u0026quot;0.68.3\u0026quot; theme: academic deploy: steps: - install-packages: packages: git ssh-client - lukevivier/gh-pages@0.2.1: token: $GIT_TOKEN basedir: public repo: olejorik/olejorik.github.io  Actually, it was a trial-and-error process (as can be seen in the commit history of the site), but I omit all these details üòâ.\nSummary To make your rendered version of a Hugo website automatically updated after every change you push the source repo, log in to Wercker with your GitHub account, add an application with two pipelines in a workflow, named build and deploy and add a corresponding wercker.yml file to the root of your source repo.\nAfter everything works as expected, you might want to delete the submodule public from the source repo.\n","date":1586770912,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586770912,"objectID":"5657b78fb2154895ccc2f41884132c26","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/post/automatic-deployment/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T09:41:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/automatic-deployment/","section":"post","summary":"How to make a rendered version of a Hugo site to be always up to date to its source","tags":["website","tools"],"title":"Automatic Deployment","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["What have I learned today"],"content":"After entering forestry.io, granting them access to the source repo of website and performing initial setup, I\u0026rsquo;ve got an environment where I can create and edit posts.

However, many wavefront measurement techniques implicitly approximate the gradient of the wavefront by the gradients of the basis functions. For a finite number of approximation terms, the transition from a basis to its gradient might introduce an aliasing error. To simplify the measurements, another set of functions, an \"optimal basis\"with orthogonal gradients, is often introduced, for instance Lukosz-Braat polynomials. This paper first shows that such bases do not necessarily eliminate the aliasing error and secondly considers the problem of finding an alias-free basis on example of second-moment-based indirect wavefront sensing methods. It demonstrates that for these methods any alias-free basis should be formed by functions simultaneously orthogonal in two dot-products and be composed of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. The fitness of such alias-free basis for optical applications is analyzed by means of numerical simulations on typical aberrations occurring in microscopy and astronomy. ¬© 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","tags":["Adaptive optics","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Orthogonal functions; Wavefronts","Basis functions; Laplace operator; Optical applications; Orthogonal basis; Orthogonal gradients; Wave-front sensing; Wavefront measurement","Zernike polynomials","Aberrations"],"title":"Alias-free basis for modal sensorless adaptive optics using the second moment of intensity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Adaptive optics can be employed to correct for phase aberrations and improve image quality. However, conventional adaptive optics can only correct a single phase aberration for the whole field of view (isoplanatic correction) while, due to the highly heterogeneous nature of biological tissues, the sample induced aberrations in microscopy often vary throughout the field of view (anisoplanatic aberration), limiting significantly the effectiveness of adaptive optics. This paper reports on a new approach for aberration correction in laser scanning confocal microscopy, in which a spatial light modulator is used to generate multiple excitation points in the sample to simultaneously scan different portions of the field of view with completely independent correction, achieving anisoplanatic compensation of sample induced aberrations, in a significantly shorter time compared to sequential isoplanatic correction of multiple image subregions. The method was tested in whole Drosophila brains and in larval Zebrafish, each showing a dramatic improvement in resolution and sharpness when compared to conventional isoplanatic adaptive optics. ¬© 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","tags":["Adaptive optics","Image enhancement","Aberration correction","Biological microscopy;  Biological tissues;  Laser scanning confocal microscopy","animal experiment;  animal tissue;  article;  brain;  compensation;  confocal microscopy;  Drosophila;  excitation;  laser microscopy;  nonhuman;  optics;  zebra fish"],"title":"Anisoplanatic adaptive optics in parallelized laser scanning microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

The algorithm is in the class of alternating minimization methods and can be adjusted for applications with either known or unknown amplitude of the field in the pupil. The algorithm outperforms existing solutions for high-numerical-aperture phase retrieval: (1) the generalization of the method of Hanser et al., based on extension of the scalar diffraction theory by representing the out-of-focus diversity applied to the image by a spherical cap, and (2) the method of Braat et al., which assumes through the use of extended Nijboer--Zernike expansion the phase to be smooth. The former is limited in terms of accuracy due to model deviations, while the latter is of high computational complexity and excludes phase retrieval problems where the phase is discontinuous or sparse. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and practicability of the proposed algorithm in various practically relevant simulations.","tags":["Diffraction theory; Fast Fourier transforms; Fourier transforms; Imaging systems; Phase retrieval; Wavefront aberrations"],"title":"Phase retrieval based on the vectorial model of point spread function","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I was trying to prove the convergence of TIP algorithm and suddenly realized I was doing pop art instead\u0026hellip;         \n","date":1575810049,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575810049,"objectID":"95e1c8d65203ddf4504f0604edb83048","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/funnyplots/popart/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T14:00:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/funnyplots/popart/","section":"funnyplots","summary":"I was trying to prove the convergence of TIP algorithm and suddenly realized I was doing pop art instead\u0026hellip;","tags":[],"title":"Pop art","type":"funnyplots"},{"authors":["Pieter Piscaer","Oleg Soloviev","Michel Verhaegen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"9b7726b23037edbf49c77564a5618ede","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/publication/piscaer-19/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T11:16:59.721999Z","relpermalink":"/publication/piscaer-19/","section":"publication","summary":"A new wavefront sensorless adaptive optics method is presented that can accurately correct for time-varying aberrations using a single focal plane image at each sample instance.

The new algorithm results in significant improvements when an accurate model of the aberration's temporal dynamics is known, by applying a Kalman filter and optimal control. Moreover, where existing wavefront sensorless adaptive optics methods update all modes sequentially, the information of the Kalman filter is used to select and update the modes that are expected to give the greatest improvement in performance. The performance is analyzed in a simulation of an adaptive optics system for atmospheric turbulence. The results show that the new method is able to correct for the aberration more accurately for higher wind speeds and higher noise levels than existing algorithms.","tags":["Atmospheric turbulence; Free space optics; Image processing; Image quality; Phase retrieval; Wavefront aberrations"],"title":"Predictive wavefront sensorless adaptive optics for time-varying aberrations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"MADEin4 stands for Metrology Advances for Digitized ECS industry 4.0, an ECSEL JU project focussing on the productivity enhancement in \u0026ldquo;Industry 4.0\u0026rdquo;.\nGlasses for AI Our part in the project is to increase the throughput of the quality control lines.

Below is a slightly modified version of the example.\nCode example Here is some periodic data with period $T =12.46$ with some noise added, plotted for the discrete values of $x = 1,\\ldots,100$:\nn = 1000; per = 12.46; pdata = Table[Sin[2 \\[Pi] x/per], {x, n}] + RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {n}]; ListPlot[pdata, AspectRatio -\u0026gt; 1/3, PlotStyle -\u0026gt; PointSize[.003], ImageSize -\u0026gt; 900]  Looks quite random for us humans, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?

A common requirement when addressing multiple targets sparsely distributed in three dimensions is the generation of a points cloud, focusing excitation light in multiple diffraction-limited locations throughout the sample. Calculation of this type of holograms is most commonly performed with either the high-speed, low-performance random superposition algorithm, or the low-speed, high performance Gerchberg‚ÄìSaxton algorithm. This paper presents a variation of the Gerchberg‚ÄìSaxton algorithm that, by only performing iterations on a subset of the data, according to compressive sensing principles, is rendered significantly faster while maintaining high quality outputs. The algorithm is presented in high-efficiency and high-uniformity variants. All source code for the method implementation is available as Supplementary Materials and as open-source software. The method was tested computationally against existing algorithms, and the results were confirmed experimentally on a custom setup for in-vivo multiphoton optogenetics. The results clearly show that the proposed method can achieve computational speed performances close to the random superposition algorithm, while retaining the high performance of the Gerchberg‚ÄìSaxton algorithm, with a minimal hologram quality loss. ¬© 2018 by the authors.","tags":null,"title":"Fast calculation of computer generated holograms for 3D photostimulation through compressive-sensing Gerchberg‚ÄìSaxton algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543180008,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543180008,"objectID":"90b59b1e8982b701d788d83ce0d4702b","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/project/eye-tracker/","publishdate":"2018-11-25T22:06:48+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/eye-tracker/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"High Accuracy Eye Tracker for Proton Clinic environment","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"For high values of numerical apertures (think microscopes), the standard phase retrieval methods are not reliable.\nIn this project, we work on adjusting and expanding the low-NA algorithms to the high values of NA.\n","date":1530220008,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530220008,"objectID":"b1fdd0892553ab32165c38f212e5e77b","permalink":"https://olejorik.github.io/project/high-na-phase-retrieval/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T21:06:48Z","relpermalink":"/project/high-na-phase-retrieval/","section":"project","summary":"For high values of numerical apertures (think microscopes), the standard phase retrieval methods are not reliable.\nIn this project, we work on adjusting and expanding the low-NA algorithms to the high values of NA.","tags":[],"title":"Phase retrieval for high NA cases","type":"project"},{"authors":["O.

This paper reports a technique for optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy capable of correcting dynamic aberrations in any fluorescent sample during the acquisition. This is achieved by implementing adaptive optics in a non conventional confocal microscopy setup, with multiple programmable confocal apertures, in which out of focus light can be separately detected, and used to optimize the correction performance with a sampling frequency an order of magnitude faster than the imaging rate of the system.

We show that the resolution can be improved by adaptively matching the size of the subaperture to the characteristic size of the turbulence. Further improvement is achieved by the deconvolution of a number of subimages registered simultaneously through multiple subapertures. Different implementations of multiaperture geometry, including pupil multiplication, pupil image sampling, and a plenoptic telescope, are considered. Resolution improvement has been demonstrated on a ‚àº550m horizontal turbulent path, using a combination of aperture sampling, speckle image processing, and, optionally, frame selection. ¬© 2011 Optical Society of America.","tags":["Characteristic size; Frame selection; Multi aperture; Pupil images; Pupil segmentation; Resolution improvement; Speckle imaging; Sub-apertures; Subaperture; Subimages; Turbulent atmosphere","Image processing; Speckle","Atmospheric turbulence"],"title":"Speckle imaging through turbulent atmosphere based on adaptable pupil segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Detection and correction can be accomplished in a feedback-loop adaptive optical system comprising a wavefront sensor and a deformable mirror. The loop must operate at a frequency higher than 300 Hz, the maximum laser power entering the eye should observe safety regulations and the accuracy of aberration detection should be better than Œª/4.
