After entering forestry.io, granting them access to the source repo of website and performing initial setup, I've got an environment where I can create and edit posts. There is an opportunity to preview the post, and all the post meta-fields can be filled in here.

The difference is minimal. It might be helpful for a company web-site, where the users should not bother about git commit _etc._

There is however one good thing---I can use Grammarly tool to check my English. :-)
