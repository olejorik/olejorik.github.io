_MADEin4 stands for **Metrology Advances for Digitized ECS industry 4.0**, an ECSEL JU project focussing on the productivity enhancement in "Industry 4.0"._

# Glasses for AI

Our part in the project is to increase the throughput of the quality control lines. Currently, the most important (e.g. with the most impact on the human safety) quality control is performed by humans. In Industry 4.0, this task will be delegated to AI, which will classify the parts being defect or not based on the video input. If a human inspector has a myopy, we can prescribe eygleasses. But what if AI has a difficulties with recognising the important features in the image? Would simple increasing the image resolution and sharpness help the  AI in its classification job?

These are the problems we are going to address in this project.
