## Puzzles

This section contains a set of geometrical puzzles related to the problem of blind deconvolution.
The puzzles do not require any knowledge on their deconvolutional origin and can be (I hope) enjoyed as is.


If you are interested in connection of these puzzles to blind deconvolution algorithm named TIP, please read these handouts of a talk I gave at CSI meting in 2017.
The handouts are however not complete and contain a number of errors.
I'm reworking them in a tutorial which will be posted here.
