abstract = "We describe an approach that offers an almost real time image enhancement through turbulent and wavy media. The approach consists in a combination of optimization-based adaptive optics with digital multi-frame v-post-processing. Applications in astronomical and terrestrial imaging - where the image features are initially unresolved due to loss of contrast, blur, vibrations and image wander - have been illustrated by experimental results. A new software from Flexible Optical BV is presented which extends the capabilities of modern imaging systems, in combination with adaptive optics, or standalone. Â© 2012 SPIE."
