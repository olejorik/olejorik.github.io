abstract = "Nanometric control of optical quality is relevant in many different fields, ranging from Ophthalmology to Lithography, where ordinary setups suffer from optical aberrations. Most common aberrations feature amplitudes in the nanometer range and are often mapped within apertures on the order of micrometers to centimeters. Compensation of these distortions demand devices with structural resolution that is nanometric in the vertical direction (Y-nano) and micrometric on the horizontal plane (X-micro). This paper focuses on our recent research progress on wavefront detection and correction, involving sensors, actuators and static components fabricated in the scope of standard Silicon technologies. It also introduces concepts for the homogeneous and smooth texturization of solar cells."
