abstract = "Based on the analysis of factors that influence atmospheric imaging over long turbulent horizontal paths, we consider a number of practical configurations of opto-electronic surveillance systems with optimized performance. Our approach is based on simultaneous quasi real-time processing of a number of images obtained through uncorrelated atmospheric paths, using either temporal or spatial multiplexing. Practical results obtained on a 4.25 km imaging path using newly developed imaging system, based on temporal multiplexing, combined with image restoration based on projection on convex sets, are reported. Potential applications include optical and IR long-range security and military surveillance, unmanned aircraft imaging systems and naval optical imaging and warning systems. Â© 2011 SPIE."
