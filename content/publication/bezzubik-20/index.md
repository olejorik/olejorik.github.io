abstract: "The development results of a telescopic system that allows high-quality digital images of distant objects to be obtained in horizontal routes with a high spatial resolution, which in an extreme case tends toward the diffraction limit, are reported in this study. A three-channel multi-aperture digital telescopic system with super-resolution realizes two methods of digital image processing that can compensate the distortions introduced by a non-uniform distribution of the refractive index along the optical observation path. A comparative analysis of these methods was conducted, and their advantages and limitations are described in this paper. The results of theoretical investigations are confirmed experimentally by observing stationary and dynamic objects under the conditions of heavy atmospheric turbulence. The advantages of a three-channel multiple-aperture digital telescopic system design with a super-resolution over optical systems built based on traditional schematics are demonstrated."
