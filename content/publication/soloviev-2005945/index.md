abstract = "This article presents a prototype of a CMOS phase sensor for high accuracy (1 Angstrom) heterodyne interferometry. Switched integrators realization of a lock-in pixel for 4-bucket phase detection algorithm is described and illustrated by experimental results. Factors that limit the accuracy of this implementation and possible ways for its improvement are discussed."
