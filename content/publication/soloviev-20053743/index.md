abstract = "We propose phase retrieval from three or more interferograms corresponding to different tilts of an object wavefront. The algorithm uses the information contained in the interferogram differences to reduce the problem to phase shifting. Three interferograms is the minimum for restoring the phase over most of the image. Four or more interferograms are needed to restore the phase over the whole image. The method works with images including open and closed fringes in any combination. Â© 2005 Optical Society of America."
