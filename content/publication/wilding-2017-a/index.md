abstract = "By taking multiple input-output measurements, it is shown how to determine the input to an optical system that corrects unknown phase aberrations without interferometric measurements or online iterative optimization within a couple of seconds. It is shown to work in simulations and experiment. This technique may also be used to acquire the complex field in the pupil, hereby permitting a complex field image to be acquired.
