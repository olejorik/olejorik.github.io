abstract = "We consider a wavefront sensor combining scattering pupil with a plenoptic imager. Such a sensor utilizes the same reconstruction principle as the Hartmann-Shack sensor, however it is free from the ambiguity of the spot location caused by the periodic structure of the sensor matrix, and allows for wider range of measured aberrations. In our study, sensor with scattering pupil has demonstrated a good match between the introduced and reconstructed aberrations, both in the simulation and experiment. The concept is expected to be applicable to optical metrology of strongly distorted wavefronts, especially for measurements through dirty, distorted, or scattering windows and pupils, such as cataract eyes.
