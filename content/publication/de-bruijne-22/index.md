abstract: "We have applied a combination of blind deconvolution and deep learning to the processing of Shack--Hartmann images. By using the intensity information contained in spot positions, and the fine structure of the separate images created by the lenslets, we have increased the sensitivity and resolution of the sensor over the limit defined by standard processing of spot displacements only. We also have demonstrated the applicability of the method to wavefront sensing using extended objects as a reference."
