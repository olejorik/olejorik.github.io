abstract = "The fast sampling multipixel detector for a heterodyne interferometer with angstrom precision was discussed. The purpose of the two approaches to the operational principle of the phase sensor, was to minimize the data flow from the sensor and processing time of it. The two methods represent the digital and analog signal approaches."
