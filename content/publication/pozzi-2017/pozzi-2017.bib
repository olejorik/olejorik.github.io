 abstract = {We present a new method for fast wavefront sensorless correction of phase aberrations in confocal microscopy, based on a physical model of the distribution of fluorescence light rejected by the pinhole. The method is described, and an experimental confirmation of the method is provided. Â© 2017 OSA.},
