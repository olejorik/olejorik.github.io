abstract = "A possible solution for the global warming problem consists of scattering the solar radiation by a cloud of screens, placed near the inner Lagrange point (L1), between the sun and the earth. The thin film material for such a screen should have a high longevity in space environment, low areal density, high on-axis scattering, very low integral reflectivity over the whole solar spectrum, and good handling properties such as foldability and robustness. We report on experimental fabrication of free-standing robust nitride films satisfying to most optical and mechanical requirements for such a screen. Â© 2015 Optical Society of America."
