 abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables the high-resolution visualization of organelle structures and the precise localization of individual proteins. However, the expected resolution is not achieved in tissue as the imaging conditions deteriorate. Sample-induced aberrations distort the point spread function (PSF), and high background fluorescence decreases the localization precision. Here, we synergistically combine sensorless adaptive optics (AO), in-situ 3D-PSF calibration, and a single-objective lens inclined light sheet microscope (SOLEIL), termed (AO-SOLEIL), to mitigate deep tissue-induced deteriorations. We apply AO-SOLEIL on several dSTORM samples including brains of adult Drosophila. We observed a 2x improvement in the estimated axial localization precision with respect to widefield without aberration correction while we used synergistic solution. AO-SOLEIL enhances the overall imaging resolution and further facilitates the visualization of sub-cellular structures in tissue.},
