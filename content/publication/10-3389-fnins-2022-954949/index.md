abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables the high-resolution
  visualization of organelle structures and the precise localization of individual
  proteins. However, the expected resolution is not achieved in tissue as the imaging
  conditions deteriorate. Sample-induced aberrations distort the point spread function
  (PSF), and high background fluorescence decreases the localization precision. Here,
  we synergistically combine sensorless adaptive optics (AO), in-situ 3D-PSF calibration,
  and a single-objective lens inclined light sheet microscope (SOLEIL), termed (AO-SOLEIL),
  to mitigate deep tissue-induced deteriorations. We apply AO-SOLEIL on several dSTORM
  samples including brains of adult Drosophila. We observed a 2x improvement in the
  estimated axial localization precision with respect to widefield without aberration
  correction while we used synergistic solution. AO-SOLEIL enhances the overall imaging
  resolution and further facilitates the visualization of sub-cellular structures
  in tissue.
