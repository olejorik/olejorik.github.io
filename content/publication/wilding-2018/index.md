abstract: "The light-sheet fluorescence microscopy is an excellent tool for the investigation of large three dimensional microscopy samples at the cellular level, however, the ability to resolve features is strongly affected by the presence of scattering and aberrations. These effects are two fold in light-sheet microscopy, as the illumination path providing the optical sectioning and the fluorescence detection path are both affected by the aberrations in different ways. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed hybrid adaptive optical and computational microscopy techniques to remove the effect of the aberrations in both the excitation and the fluorescence paths of these microscopes.
