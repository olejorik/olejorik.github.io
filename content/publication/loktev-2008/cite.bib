 abstract = {We describe a compact integrated module implementing a low-cost adaptive optics system. It is targeted as a correction system for small telescopes with primary mirror diameter up to 1 m, operating on a natural guide star with magnitude at least 4 (for a 25 cm telescope). It is supposed to provide stable diffraction-limited imaging of stars, double stars, planets and artificial bodies in various seeing conditions. Besides, it allows correcting for static aberrations of the telescope, observer's ocular aberrations and fine adjustment of focus. The first on-sky tests have demonstrated closed-loop operation with correction for aberrations.},
