abstract = "A methodology for retrieving the unknown object distribution and point-spread functions (PSFs) from a set of images acquired in the presence of temporal phase aberrations is presented in this paper. The method works by finding optimal complimentary linear filters for multi-frame deconvolution. The algorithm uses undemanding computational operations and few a priori, making it simple, fast and robust even at low signal-to-noise ratios. Results of numerical simulations and experimental tests are given as empirical proof, alongside comparisons with other algorithms found in the literature. Â© 2017 Optical Society of America."
