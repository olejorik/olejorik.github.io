I sometimes feel as though I no longer know why I practise aikido---it has become such an integral part of my life. I started practising in 1995 in [Moscow](https://oshinkan.ru/), stopped in 1999, and resumed in 2011 in [Delft](http://www.aikidodelft.nl). In 2016 I passed my _shodan_ exams, in November 2019 I obtained my _nidan_, and in November 2023 my _sandan_.

As part of the _shodan_ examinations, I wrote an essay on an aikido-related topic, which provided me with a good opportunity to reflect on why aikido is so important to me.  
[The essay is available in PDF format.](Oleg1als.pdf)

For my _sandan_ exam, I wrote another essay, this time on the topic of the language of aikido.
