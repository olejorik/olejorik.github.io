Sometime I feel like I don't know anymore why am I practicing aikido -- so integral part of my life it became.
I started to practice in 1995 in [Moscow](https://www.ooshinkan.ru/), stopped in 1999, and restarted in 2011 in [Delft](http://www.aikidodelft.nl).
In 2016 I've passed my *shodan* examens, in November 2019 I've got my *nidan*.

Part of the shodan examination was writing an essay on aikido-related topic, which gave me a good opportunity to reflect on why aikido is so important for me. 

[The essay is available in PDF format.](Oleg1als.pdf)
