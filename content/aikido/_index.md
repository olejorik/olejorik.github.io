Sometimes I feel like I don't know anymore why I am practising aikido---such an integral part of my life it has become. I started practicing in 1995 in [Moscow](https://www.ooshinkan.ru/), stopped in 1999, and restarted in 2011 in [Delft](http://www.aikidodelft.nl). In 2016 I've passed my _shodan_ exams, in November 2019 I've got my _nidan_.

Part of the shodan examination was writing an essay on an aikido-related topic, which gave me a good opportunity to reflect on why aikido is so important for me.

[The essay is available in PDF format.](Oleg1als.pdf)
