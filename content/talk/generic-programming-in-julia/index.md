summary:
abstract: A small presentation describing my personal experience with *General Programming* in Julia. For a mathematician, it is sometimes difficult to get started with programming abstract concepts, which you can so clearly describe on paper. I heard that *Julia* can be used to overcome this barrier and decided to give it a try on an example of *Alternating projections* class of methods. It appeared indeed quite easy to use and I even was able to write a small package [AlternatingProjections.jl](https://olejorik.github.io/AlternatingProjections.jl/latest/).
