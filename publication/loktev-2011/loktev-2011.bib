 abstract = {In this paper we present some experimental results of speckle imaging for near-diffraction-limited observation of ground-based scenery and astronomical objects through atmospheric turbulence. The method of alternating projections onto convex sets is used for iterative reconstruction of the point-spread function (PSF), combined with Wiener filtering for deconvolution and several pre-processing techniques. A modification of the optical system with aperture segmentation is considered. The results of imaging on a horizontal path and astronomical imaging are reported and compared with time averaged and best frame images. Apparent image improvement is demonstrated in a field much wider than the isoplanatic patch size. Â© 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},
