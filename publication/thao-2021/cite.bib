 abstract = {We present the convergence analysis of convex combination of the alternating projection and Douglas–Rachford operators for solving the phase retrieval problem. New convergence criteria for iterations generated by the algorithm are established by applying various schemes of numerical analysis and exploring both physical and mathematical characteristics of the phase retrieval problem. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the algorithm over the other widely known projection methods in practically relevant simulations.},
