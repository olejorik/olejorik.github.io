 abstract = {In this work, we present a new confocal laser scanning microscope capable to perform sensorless wavefront optimization in real time. The device is a parallelized laser scanning microscope in which the excitation light is structured in a lattice of spots by a spatial light modulator, while a deformable mirror provides aberration correction and scanning. A binary DMD is positioned in an image plane of the detection optical path, acting as a dynamic array of reflective confocal pinholes, images by a high performance CMOS camera. A second camera detects images of the light rejected by the pinholes for sensorless aberration correction. Â© 2018 SPIE.},
